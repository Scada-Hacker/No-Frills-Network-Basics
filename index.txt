No Frills, does what it says on the tin, Network Basics.

Lets get some things out the way

Who am I ?

Just an IT manager with a lot of experience and a lot of niche experience in OT/ICS security.

There are 2 things I'm very aware of : 

1. Those that want the quick and easy win, without spending any time learning. Everything is expected to be handed on a plate. I once put this down to complete and utter lazyness. And in a sense it is, but thats due to technology becoming so simple and pushbutton freindly its turning the world in to drones.

2. Even worse are those that exploit this. Charging ridiculous amounts of money, knowing the same individuals will lap it up, only to be dissapointed when what they purchase is lacking any real content, or containing content that can be easily found with a search engine.

I cant do much about number 1. If you fall into this catergory, I doubt this is for you. I can, for those willing to learn and do research without constantly asking "next question please" do something about the second.

As i said - no frills.
